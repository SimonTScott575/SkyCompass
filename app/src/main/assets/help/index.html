    <h2>Time, Date and Location</h2>

    <p>Location is specified in latitude and longitude.  You can change this by dragging the marker across the map or tap the button to automatically find your location.</p>

    <p>You must change the time zone to your local time zone to get accurate results.</p>

    <h2>Compass</h2>

    <p>Use the compass to view where the moon and sun will be in the sky.  They are positioned similarly to as if you are looking down on the earth.</p>
    
    <p>North, South, East and West are marked on the outer edge.</p>
    
    <p>The Sun and Moon are marked by yellow and grey circles.  Dotted lines indicate where they are predicted to be in the past and future.</p>

    <p>Circles marked by degrees indicate the how high they will appear in the sky.</p>

    <p>Tap the compass symbol in the toolbar to automatically orient the compass to point North.</p>
