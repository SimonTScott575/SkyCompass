    <p>Sky Compass tracks the sun and moon positions in the sky - past, present and future.  Including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sun and Moon positions in the sky</li>
        <li>Sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset times</li>
        <li>Phases of the Moon</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For entertainment and educational purposes only.</p>

    <h2>Date, Time and Location</h2>

    <p>Location is specified in latitude and longitude.  You can change this by dragging the marker across the map or tap the button to automatically find your location.</p>

    <p>Ensure the time zone is set correctly for the current location.</p>

    <h2>Compass</h2>

    <p>Use the compass to view where the Sun and Moon will be in the sky.  They are marked by yellow and grey circles.  They are positioned similarly to as if you are looking down on the earth.</p>

    <p>North, South, East and West are marked on the outer edge.</p>

    <p>Tap the compass symbol in the toolbar to automatically orient the compass to point to magnetic North.</p>

    <h2>Night Mode</h2>

    <p>Tap the moon icon in the toolbar to enter night mode and tap the sun icon to exit night mode.  Set night mode to automatically use the system default in settings found by tapping the gear icon.</p>
