    <p>Sky Compass tells you all you need for simple astronomical observations of the sun and moon - past, present and future.  Including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sun and Moon positions in the sky</li>
        <li>Sunset and sunrise times</li>
        <li>Phases of the Moon</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For education and entertainment purposes only.</p>

    <h2>Time, Date and Location</h2>

    <p>Location is specified in latitude and longitude.  You can change this by dragging the marker across the map or tap the button to automatically find your location.</p>

    <p>Make sure the time zone is set correctly for the current location.</p>

    <h2>Compass</h2>

    <p>Use the compass to view where the Sun and Moon will be in the sky.  They are marked by yellow and grey circles.  They are positioned similarly to as if you are looking down on the earth.</p>
    
    <p>North, South, East and West are marked on the outer edge.</p>
    
    <p>Tap the compass symbol in the toolbar to automatically orient the compass to point North.</p>
